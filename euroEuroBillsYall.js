// TODO: Euro coins are denominated as follows: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cent, €1 and €2. Given this, how many different ways can change be made for a €5 note? Write a program to answer this question.
// Initial thought process: The higher denomination can be made up of lower denomination. For instance, 2 cents can be one 2 cents or two 1 cents; 5 cents can be two 2 cents and one 1 cent, which is just five 1 cent.
